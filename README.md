## Draft Text Books
I have draft version of a four semester introductory physics series.  There are some quirks in what I have done. There are not problem sets in the text books.  These could be used with an on-line problem set like Sapling Learning or Mastering Physics.  I have problem sets done for some classes, but I don't want to publish them online at this point.

[Introductory Physics I Mechanics](https://rtlines.github.io/PH121_Text_Book_0.31071.pdf)
<br />
[Introductory Physics II Waves, Thermodynamics, and Optics](https://rtlines.github.io/ph123_text_book.v0.52.pdf)
<br />
[Introductory Physics III Electric and Magnetic field theory](https://rtlines.github.io/Lecture_Notes_PH-220.pdf)
<br />
[Introductory Physics IV Modern Physics (Special Relativity and Begining Quantum Mechanics](https://rtlines.github.io/lecture_notesph279.pdf)
<br /><br />
And here are two lab manuals, one for a first laboratory experience empnasizizing exerpimental design teaching measurement, error analysis, and Euler's method. The second teaching instsrument design using Arduinos.<br /><br />
