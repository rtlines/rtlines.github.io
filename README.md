## Draft Text Books
I have draft version of a four semester introductory physics series.  There are some quirks in what I have done. There are not problem sets in the text books.  These could be used with an on-line problem set like Sapling Learning or Mastering Physics.  I have problem sets done for some classes, but I don't want to publish them online at this point.
